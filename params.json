These click events will record x-y pairings in a Points array.\r\n\r\n\tvar pointsArray = [];\r\n\r\nThe magic happens here:  We sort the points via a sorting delegate.\r\n\r\n\tpoints.sort(pointSortDelegate);\r\n\r\nThe resulting array forms a clock-wise polygon.  We then use standard canvas line-drawing capabilities to connect the dots.\r\n\r\nTODO:  We can add animations in the line drawing.  But it is not necessary for this exercise.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
